This folder was used with tutorials and other sources to learn about how to use the libraries I used for the virtual-assistant project.
This folder also includes the different scripts I played around with to learn about the libraries. For example, this folder includes
the version of the Virtual Assistant where I used the google speech-to-text model and also includes a script I was using for Spotify
commands before moving it into the VirtualAssistant code itself. Any time code was not mine or I was following a tutorial to learn the
features of a library, I credited the source at the top of the script.
